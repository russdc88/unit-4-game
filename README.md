# unit-4-game

In this game, I am using CSS, HTML, and Javascript. I have imported Bootstrap and Jquery as well to use.

Far as the html, everything but with ids #randomNumber, #totalCrystalScore, #playerWin, and #computerWin.

In javascript, I first defined my variables for all the scores and random numbers. I then created reset function and takes all of those variables and resets them. 

After that I have created the gem functionality. Then they add random score with itself plus value of the gem.It then returns the value in html under the #totalCrystalScore. Each gem does the same thing.

I created conditional statements for each gem and when the player wins, he gets a point and the reset function is called. Same thing goes if the player loses, but the the computer gets the point.


Far as CSS goes, I have only adjusted font size, font color, and background colors.

Html has basic text, but added some bootstrap that would center the text.
